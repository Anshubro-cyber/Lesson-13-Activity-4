LaFerrari, project name F150,[4] is a limited production mid-engine, mild hybrid sports car built by Italian automotive manufacturer Ferrari.[5] LaFerrari means "The Ferrari" in Italian; this is intended to be the definitive Ferrari.LaFerrari is based on findings from testing of the FXX development prototype[5] and on research being conducted by the Millechili Project at the University of Modena. Association with the Millechili Project led to speculation during development that the car would weigh under 1,000 kg (2,205 lb),[7] but a dry weight of around 1,255 kg (2,767 lb) was claimed.[8] Only 499 units were produced, and each cost more than 1 million Euro
